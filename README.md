A simple Office AddIn to stop colleagues sending emails while I am away from my computer

We've all had an occasion where we have forgotten to lock Windows when we head off to grab a drink, and most of us have encountered mischevious colleagues who like to send embarassing spoof emails from our computer while we aren't looking.

Well now our problems are solved.

When the Outlook user attempts to click the "Send" button on an inspector window they are presented with a password box before the email will be sent ;)

WARNING: This is is not invincible; the AddIn can easily be removed by anyone who knows their way around Outlook/Windows. But, it WILL buy you an extra few minutes to catch the perpetrator in the act.
